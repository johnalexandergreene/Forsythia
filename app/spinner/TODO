we are going to enhance the forsythia spinner

OPTIONS

circles, split, concentric. As final details on hex leaves

noise. HSB maybe. An animated static. Could be more near strokes

Runes. Like those runes on that sword in gods and monsters

Runes. Like 6 square

sound. Anything. Hisses, grinds, flabbers, thumps, etc

a window fulla writhing conway

blinkers, strobes, flickers

a texture

a blanketflower

better strokes. Use the noice renderer. The ZCell one
merge and darken or something

make the spinner infinite

make spinner configured by a text file

kill the full-stripe bilateral symmetry situations. 
Probably via the grammar. 
Or maybe kill symmetry at level 1 and 2 programmatically

2) abstract out renderer. clean up code

3) create zcell based renderer. we can do it faster than the default
